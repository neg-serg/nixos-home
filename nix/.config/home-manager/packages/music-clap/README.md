# music_clap

Standalone CLI to compute LAION-CLAP embeddings for audio files.

```sh
music-clap ~/music --text "dreamy shoegaze" --dump ~/.cache/music-clap
```

## CPU parallelism

By default PyTorch chooses a conservative number of CPU worker threads. Use the
new flags to let CLAP analysis utilise more cores:

```sh
music-clap track.flac --text "blackened doom metal" --torch-threads 8
```

`--torch-inter-op-threads` is also available when you need to tune PyTorch's
operator inter-op pool separately.

## Checkpoints & cache

`music-clap` writes nothing into the Nix store. Model checkpoints download to
`$LAION_CLAP_CACHE` (or `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/laion_clap`, falling back to
`~/.cache/laion_clap`). To persist per-track embeddings, pass `--dump` so the
CLI mirrors your audio tree into a writable directory:

```sh
music-clap ~/music --text "doom metal" --dump ~/.cache/music-clap
```

Without `--dump` the embeddings stay in memory and are not saved.
